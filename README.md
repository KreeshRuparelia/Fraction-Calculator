**Fraction Calculator**

**DESCRIPTION:**
The Fraction Calculator allows the user to input improper/mixed fractions and get the answer.

**TRY IT OUT!**
In order to test out the **Fraction Calculator** for yourself you must have Java installed on your
computer. Upon installing Java, you can download both the files from the repository and open them up (ensure all files are in the same folder) using your IDE (Integrated Developement Environment) of choice. Upon opening the project, go over and select the file *FractionCalculator.java* and run the file. Running the file will prompt you to input an expression. Type in any mixed/improper fraction, select your operator, and what you would like to add/subtract/multiply/divde.

**SAMPLE CASES:**
- 1/2 + 4
- 3 1/2 - 5 2/3
- 4/5 * 5/7
- 9 / 3 1/2
